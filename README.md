# GPS-Toll-based-System-Simulation-using-Pytho

The project is a dynamic toll pricing and management system implemented using Python. It calculates toll charges based on several factors such as toll zone, traffic congestion, vehicle type, and distance traveled. It also calculates penalties for speeding and toll waivers based on vehicle status at toll zones. Furthermore, it visualizes toll zones, vehicle routes, and traffic congestion on an interactive map
